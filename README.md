# RPI-Project
Hey Guys feel free to add any code but please be sure to leave comments.
That way it will be readable for everybody else. If you're just coming here 
for the show please feel free to comments any innovative ideas. This first project
will be a RFID reader door lock. We will be utilizing The GPIO pins on the pi and a 
servo motor. I will continously be adding to this file throughout the project, especailly if 
any concerns were to surface.
